Task 0:
BigO of O(1), because accessing a accessing a list takes on O(1) 
and there is two lines both O(1) which approximates to O(1).

Task 1:
BigO(n), because the access is sequential which results in looping through every element

Task2:
BigO(n) because we are performing a full scan.

Task3:
BigO of O(n log n) because the longest operation here is the sorting operation which takes n log n

Task4:
BigO of O(n log n) because the longest operation here is the sorting operation which takes n log n
